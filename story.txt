It started off as a perfectly normal day in Berlin, but things were about to get interesting.
I donned my Dirndel and grabbed the keys to my BMW.
Suddenly an apfelkuchen dropped from the sky, smashing against the pavement and splattering my Dirndel!
As I tried to clean up, I heard a noise and saw a hund running at full speed towards me.
I grabbed a doener from my briefcase and threw it away from me, hoping to distract the beast.
The distraction had no effect, however, and only seemed to enrage the beast as it suddenly transformed into a Porsche and increased its speed.
I knew I had to embrace my Wettbewerbsfaehig nature and turn myself into a BMW.
We began to race, heading towards the famous Ratskeller.
Suddenly, a variety of Gebaeck started to rain from the sky, obscuring my vision.
Driving blind, I rammed into a Bratwurst stand, watching helplessly as the Porsche drove away in a cloud of flying sausages.
I barely saw the man in lederhose crossing the street in front of me in time to swerve and avoid him.
That's when I realized the local Baeckerei was shooting their products from a t-shirt cannon to promote their store!
As we raced down the hauptstrasse, the Porsche was hit by a giant bratwurst.
I tripped over a brot and landed hard. 
The former hund turned Porsch and I raced blindly down the hauptstrasse!
The haupstrasse led me right to the flughafen!
I will admit, some nice hot brot usually sounds nice...
But I must not be distracted by thoughts of food lest this wettbewerbsfaehig race end in me getting rear-ended by a Porsch.
The next thing I knew I was a crashed BMW inside a baeckerei no doubt the source of the raining gebaeck.
And i wasnt feeling too well so I decided to go get some mehlhase.
